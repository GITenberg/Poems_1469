&nbsp;&nbsp; May dedicate humbly<br />
To her grower the beauty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherewith she is comely;<br />
If the mine to the miner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The jewels that pined in it,<br />
Earth to diviner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The springs he divined in it;<br />
To the grapes the wine-pitcher<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their juice that was crushed in it,<br />
Viol to its witcher<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The music lay hushed in it;<br />
If the lips may pay Gladness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In laughters she wakened,<br />
And the heart to its sadness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weeping unslakened,<br />
If the hid and sealed coffer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose having not his is,<br />

To you, O dear givers!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I give your own giving.</p>

Dian&rsquo;s Lap.</h2>
<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>I.<br />
BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">As</span> lovers, banished
from their lady&rsquo;s face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hopeless of her grace,<br />
Fashion a ghostly sweetness in its place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fondly adore<br />
Some stealth-won cast attire she wore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A kerchief or a glove:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And at the lover&rsquo;s beck<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the glove there fleets the hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or at impetuous command<br />
Up from the kerchief floats the virgin neck:<br />
So I, in very lowlihead of love,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too shyly reverencing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To let one thought&rsquo;s light footfall smooth<br
/>
Tread near the living, consecrated thing,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Treasure me thy cast youth.<br />
This outworn vesture, tenantless of thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath yet my knee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For that, with show and semblance fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the past Her<br />
Who once the beautiful, discarded raiment bare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It cheateth me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As gale to gale drifts breath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of blossoms&rsquo; death,<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>So dropping
down the years from hour to hour<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This dead youth&rsquo;s scent is wafted me
to-day:<br />
I sit, and from the fragrance dream the flower.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, then, she looked (I say);<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so her front sunk down<br />
Heavy beneath the poet&rsquo;s iron crown:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her mouth museful
sweet&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Even as the twin lips meet)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did thought and sadness greet:<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sighs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those mournful eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So put on visibilities;<br />
As viewless ether turns, in deep on deep, to dyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, long ago,<br />
She kept her meditative paces slow<br />
Through maiden meads, with wav&egrave;d shadow and gleam<br />
Of locks half-lifted on the winds of dream,<br />
Till love up-caught her to his chariot&rsquo;s glow.<br />
Yet, voluntary, happier Proserpine!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This drooping flower of youth thou
lettest fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, faring in the cockshut-light,
astray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find on my
&rsquo;lated way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stoop, and gather for
memorial,<br />
And lay it on my bosom, and make it mine.<br />
To this, the all of love the stars allow me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dedicate and vow me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reach back through the days<br
/>
A trothed hand to the dead the last trump shall not raise.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water-wraith that cries<br />
From those eternal sorrows of thy pictured eyes<br />
Entwines and draws me down their soundless intricacies!</p>
<h3><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>II.<br
/>
TO A POET BREAKING SILENCE.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Too</span> wearily had we
and song<br />
Been left to look and left to long,<br />
Yea, song and we to long and look,<br />
Since thine acquainted feet forsook<br />
The mountain where the Muses hymn<br />
For Sinai and the Seraphim.<br />
Now in both the mountains&rsquo; shine<br />
Dress thy countenance, twice divine!<br />
From Moses and the Muses draw<br />
The Tables of thy double Law!<br />
His rod-born fount and Castaly<br />
Let the one rock bring forth for thee,<br />
Renewing so from either spring<br />
The songs which both thy countries sing:<br />
Or we shall fear lest, heavened thus long,<br />
Thou should&rsquo;st forget thy native song,<br />
And mar thy mortal melodies<br />
With broken stammer of the skies.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! let the sweet birds of
the Lord<br />
With earth&rsquo;s waters make accord;<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Teach how
the crucifix may be<br />
Carven from the laurel-tree,<br />
Fruit of the Hesperides<br />
Burnish take on Eden-trees,<br />
The Muses&rsquo; sacred grove be wet<br />
With the red dew of Olivet,<br />
And Sappho lay her burning brows<br />
In white Cecilia&rsquo;s lap of snows!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy childhood must have felt
the stings<br />
Of too divine o&rsquo;ershadowings;<br />
Its odorous heart have been a blossom<br />
That in darkness did unbosom,<br />
Those fire-flies of God to invite,<br />
Burning spirits, which by night<br />
Bear upon their laden wing<br />
To such hearts impregnating.<br />
For flowers that night-wings fertilize<br />
Mock down the stars&rsquo; unsteady eyes,<br />
And with a happy, sleepless glance<br />
Gaze the moon out of countenance.<br />
I think thy girlhood&rsquo;s watchers must<br />
Have took thy folded songs on trust,<br />
And felt them, as one feels the stir<br />
Of still lightnings in the hair,<br />
When conscious hush expects the cloud<br />
To speak the golden secret loud<br />
Which tacit air is privy to;<br />
Flasked in the grape the wine they knew,<br />
Ere thy poet-mouth was able<br />
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>For its
first young starry babble.<br />
Keep&rsquo;st thou not yet that subtle grace?<br />
Yea, in this silent interspace,<br />
God sets His poems in thy face!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loom which mortal verse
affords,<br />
Out of weak and mortal words,<br />
Wovest thou thy singing-weed in,<br />
To a rune of thy far Eden.<br />
Vain are all disguises!&nbsp; Ah,<br />
Heavenly <i>incognita</i>!<br />
Thy mien bewrayeth through that wrong<br />
The great Uranian House of Song!<br />
As the vintages of earth<br />
Taste of the sun that riped their birth,<br />
We know what never cadent Sun<br />
Thy lamp&egrave;d clusters throbbed upon,<br />
What plumed feet the winepress trod;<br />
Thy wine is flavorous of God.<br />
Whatever singing-robe thou wear<br />
Has the Paradisal air;<br />
And some gold feather it has kept<br />
Shows what Floor it lately swept!</p>

&ldquo;MANUS ANIMAM PINXIT.&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Lady</span> who
hold&rsquo;st on me dominion!<br />
Within your spirit&rsquo;s arms I stay me fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the fell<br />
Immitigate ravening of the gates of hell;<br />
And claim my right in you, most hardly won,<br />
Of chaste fidelity upon the chaste:<br />
Hold me and hold by me, lest both should fall<br />
(O in high escalade high companion!)<br />
Even in the breach of Heaven&rsquo;s assaulted wall.<br />
Like to a wind-sown sapling grow I from<br />
The clift, Sweet, of your skyward-jetting soul,&mdash;<br />
Shook by all gusts that sweep it, overcome<br />
By all its clouds incumbent: O be true<br />
To your soul, dearest, as my life to you!<br />
For if that soil grow sterile, then the whole<br />
Of me must shrivel, from the topmost shoot<br />
Of climbing poesy, and my life, killed through,<br />
Dry down and perish to the foodless root.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet Summer! unto you this swallow drew,<br />
By secret instincts inappeasable,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That did direct him well,<br />
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Lured from
his gelid North which wrought him wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wintered of sunning
song;&mdash;<br />
By happy instincts inappeasable,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah yes! that led him well,<br />
Lured to the untried regions and the new<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Climes of auspicious you;<br />
To twitter there, and in his singing dwell.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But ah! if you, my Summer, should
grow waste,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With grieving skies
o&rsquo;ercast,<br />
For such migration my poor wing was strong<br />
But once; it has no power to fare again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forth o&rsquo;er the heads of
men,<br />
Nor other Summers for its Sanctuary:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But from your mind&rsquo;s chilled
sky<br />
It needs must drop, and lie with stiffened wings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among your soul&rsquo;s forlornest
things;<br />
A speck upon your memory, alack!<br />
A dead fly in a dusty window-crack.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O
therefore you who are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What words, being to such
mysteries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As raiment to the body is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should rather
hide than tell;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chaste and intelligential love:<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose form is as
a grove<br />
Hushed with the cooing of an unseen dove;<br />
Whose spirit to my touch thrills purer far<br />
Than is the tingling of a silver bell;<br />
Whose body other ladies well might bear<br />
As soul,&mdash;yea, which it profanation were<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>For all
but you to take as fleshly woof,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being spirit truest proof;<br />
Whose spirit sure is lineal to that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which sang <i>Magnificat</i>:<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chastest, since
such you are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take this curbed
spirit of mine,<br />
Which your own eyes invest with light divine,<br />
For lofty love and high auxiliar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In daily exalt
emprise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which outsoars
mortal eyes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This soul which on your soul is
laid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As maid&rsquo;s breast against
breast of maid;<br />
Beholding how your own I have engraved<br />
On it, and with what purging thoughts have laved<br />
This love of mine from all mortality<br />
Indeed the copy is a painful one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with long
labour done!<br />
O if you doubt the thing you are, lady,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come then, and
look in me;<br />
Your beauty, Dian, dress and contemplate<br />
Within a pool to Dian consecrate!<br />
Unveil this spirit, lady, when you will,<br />
For unto all but you &rsquo;tis veil&egrave;d still:<br />
Unveil, and fearless gaze there, you alone,<br />
And if you love the image&mdash;&rsquo;tis your own!</p>

HER PORTRAIT.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Oh</span>, but the heavenly
grammar did I hold<br />
Of that high speech which angels&rsquo; tongues turn gold!<br />
So should her deathless beauty take no wrong,<br />
Praised in her own great kindred&rsquo;s fit and cognate
tongue.<br />
Or if that language yet with us abode.<br />
Which Adam in the garden talked with God!<br />
But our untempered speech descends&mdash;poor heirs!<br />
Grimy and rough-cast still from Babel&rsquo;s bricklayers:<br />
Curse on the brutish jargon we inherit,<br />
Strong but to damn, not memorise, a spirit!<br />
A cheek, a lip, a limb, a bosom, they<br />
Move with light ease in speech of working-day;<br />
And women we do use to praise even so.<br />
But here the gates we burst, and to the temple go.<br />
Their praise were her dispraise; who dare, who dare,<br />
Adulate the seraphim for their burning hair?<br />
How, if with them I dared, here should I dare it?<br />
How praise the woman, who but know the spirit?<br />
How praise the colour of her eyes, uncaught<br />
While they were coloured with her varying thought<br />
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>How her
mouth&rsquo;s shape, who only use to know<br />
What tender shape her speech will fit it to?<br />
Or her lips&rsquo; redness, when their join&egrave;d veil<br />
Song&rsquo;s fervid hand has parted till it wore them pale?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I would praise her soul
(temerarious if!),<br />
All must be mystery and hieroglyph.<br />
Heaven, which not oft is prodigal of its more<br />
To singers, in their song too great before;<br />
By which the hierarch of large poesy is<br />
Restrained to his once sacred benefice;<br />
Only for her the salutary awe<br />
Relaxes and stern canon of its law;<br />
To her alone concedes pluralities,<br />
In her alone to reconcile agrees<br />
The Muse, the Graces, and the Charities;<br />
To her, who can the trust so well conduct<br />
To her it gives the use, to us the usufruct.</p>
<p class="poetry">What of the dear administress then may<br />
I utter, though I spoke her own carved perfect way?<br />
What of her daily gracious converse known,<br />
Whose heavenly despotism must needs dethrone<br />
And subjugate all sweetness but its own?<br />
Deep in my heart subsides the infrequent word,<br />
And there dies slowly throbbing like a wounded bird.<br />
What of her silence, that outsweetens speech?<br />
What of her thoughts, high marks for mine own thoughts to
reach?<br />
Yet (Chaucer&rsquo;s antique sentence so to turn),<br />
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Most
gladly will she teach, and gladly learn;<br />
And teaching her, by her enchanting art,<br />
The master threefold learns for all he can impart.<br />
Now all is said, and all being said,&mdash;aye me!<br />
There yet remains unsaid the very She.<br />
Nay, to conclude (so to conclude I dare),<br />
If of her virtues you evade the snare,<br />
Then for her faults you&rsquo;ll fall in love with her.</p>
<p class="poetry">Alas, and I have spoken of her Muse&mdash;<br
/>
Her Muse, that died with her auroral dews!<br />
Learn, the wise cherubim from harps of gold<br />
Seduce a trepidating music manifold;<br />
But the superior seraphim do know<br />
None other music but to flame and glow.<br />
So she first lighted on our frosty earth,<br />
A sad musician, of cherubic birth,<br />
Playing to alien ears&mdash;which did not prize<br />
The uncomprehended music of the skies&mdash;<br />
The exiled airs of her far Paradise.<br />
But soon from her own harpings taking fire,<br />
In love and light her melodies expire.<br />
Now Heaven affords her, for her silenced hymn,<br />
A double portion of the seraphim.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the rich odours from her
heart that rise,<br />
My soul remembers its lost Paradise,<br />
And antenatal gales blow from Heaven&rsquo;s shores of spice;<br
/>
I grow essential all, uncloaking me<br />
From this encumbering virility,<br />
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>And feel
the primal sex of heaven and poetry:<br />
And parting from her, in me linger on<br />
Vague snatches of Uranian antiphon.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to the petty prison could
she shrink<br />
Of femineity?&mdash;Nay, but I think<br />
In a dear courtesy her spirit would<br />
Woman assume, for grace to womanhood.<br />
Or, votaress to the virgin Sanctitude<br />
Of reticent withdrawal&rsquo;s sweet, courted pale,<br />
She took the cloistral flesh, the sexual veil,<br />
Of her sad, aboriginal sisterhood;<br />
The habit of cloistral flesh which founding Eve indued.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus do I know her: but for
what men call<br />
Beauty&mdash;the loveliness corporeal,<br />
Its most just praise a thing unproper were<br />
To singer or to listener, me or her.<br />
She wears that body but as one indues<br />
A robe, half careless, for it is the use;<br />
Although her soul and it so fair agree,<br />
We sure may, unattaint of heresy,<br />
Conceit it might the soul&rsquo;s begetter be.<br />
The immortal could we cease to contemplate,<br />
The mortal part suggests its every trait.<br />
God laid His fingers on the ivories<br />
Of her pure members as on smooth&egrave;d keys,<br />
And there out-breathed her spirit&rsquo;s harmonies<br />
I&rsquo;ll speak a little proudly:&mdash;I disdain<br />
To count the beauty worth my wish or gaze,<br />
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Which the
dull daily fool can covet or obtain.<br />
I do confess the fairness of the spoil,<br />
But from such rivalry it takes a soil.<br />
For her I&rsquo;ll proudlier speak:&mdash;how could it be<br />
That I should praise the gilding on the psaltery?<br />
&rsquo;Tis not for her to hold that prize a prize,<br />
Or praise much praise, though proudest in its wise,<br />
To which even hopes of merely women rise.<br />
Such strife would to the vanquished laurels yield,<br />
Against <i>her</i> suffered to have lost a field.<br />
Herself must with herself be sole compeer,<br />
Unless the people of her distant sphere<br />
Some gold migration send to melodise the year.<br />
But first our hearts must burn in larger guise,<br />
To reformate the uncharitable skies,<br />
And so the deathless plumage to acclimatise:<br />
Since this, their sole congener in our clime,<br />
Droops her sad, ruffled thoughts for half the shivering time.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I have felt what terrors
may consort<br />
In women&rsquo;s cheeks, the Graces&rsquo; soft resort;<br />
My hand hath shook at gentle hands&rsquo; access,<br />
And trembled at the waving of a tress;<br />
My blood known panic fear, and fled dismayed,<br />
Where ladies&rsquo; eyes have set their ambuscade.<br />
The rustle of a robe hath been to me<br />
The very rattle of love&rsquo;s musketry;<br />
Although my heart hath beat the loud advance,<br />
I have recoiled before a challenging glance,<br />
Proved gay alarms where warlike ribbons dance.<br />
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>And from
it all, this knowledge have I got,&mdash;<br />
The whole that others have, is less than they have not;<br />
All which makes other women noted fair,<br />
Unnoted would remain and overshone in her.</p>
<p class="poetry">How should I gauge what beauty is her dole,<br
/>
Who cannot see her countenance for her soul;<br />
As birds see not the casement for the sky?<br />
And as &rsquo;tis check they prove its presence by,<br />
I know not of her body till I find<br />
My flight debarred the heaven of her mind.<br />
Hers is the face whence all should copied be,<br />
Did God make replicas of such as she;<br />
Its presence felt by what it does abate,<br />
Because the soul shines through tempered and mitigate:<br />
Where&mdash;as a figure labouring at night<br />
Beside the body of a splendid light&mdash;<br />
Dark Time works hidden by its luminousness;<br />
And every line he labours to impress<br />
Turns added beauty, like the veins that run<br />
Athwart a leaf which hangs against the sun.</p>
<p class="poetry">There regent Melancholy wide controls;<br />
There Earth- and Heaven-Love play for aureoles;<br />
There Sweetness out of Sadness breaks at fits,<br />
Like bubbles on dark water, or as flits<br />
A sudden silver fin through its deep infinites;<br />
There amorous Thought has sucked pale Fancy&rsquo;s breath,<br />
And Tenderness sits looking toward the lands of death<br />
There Feeling stills her breathing with her hand,<br />
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>And Dream
from Melancholy part wrests the wand<br />
And on this lady&rsquo;s heart, looked you so deep,<br />
Poor Poetry has rocked himself to sleep:<br />
Upon the heavy blossom of her lips<br />
Hangs the bee Musing; nigh her lids eclipse<br />
Each half-occulted star beneath that lies;<br />
And in the contemplation of those eyes,<br />
Passionless passion, wild tranquillities.</p>

What thou couldst never speak, nor others be!</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet (for the book is not more innocent<br />
Of what the gazer&rsquo;s eyes makes so intent),<br />

&ldquo;Bird of the sun! the stars&rsquo; wild honey-bee!<br />

Or sinks a sing&egrave;d wing to narrow nest in me?&rdquo;<br />
(Thus she might say: for not this lowly vein<br />

Oh, you mistake, dear lady, quite; nor know<br />
Ether was strict as you, its loftiness as low!</p>
<p class="poetry">The heavens do not advance their majesty<br />
Over their marge; beyond his empery<br />

That pleasaunce makes or prison, loose or chained.<br />
Too much alike or little captives me,<br />
For all oppression is captivity.<br />
What groweth to its height demands no higher;<br />
The limit limits not, but the desire.<br />
Give but my spirit its desir&egrave;d scope,&mdash;<br />
A giant in a pismire, I not grope;<br />
Deny it,&mdash;and an ant, with on my back<br />
A firmament, the skiey vault will crack.<br />
Our minds make their own Termini, nor call<br />
The issuing circumscriptions great or small;<br />
So high constructing Nature lessons to us all:<br />
Who optics gives accommodate to see<br />
Your countenance large as looks the sun to be,<br />
And distant greatness less than near humanity.</p>

An equal spaciousness of bondage find<br />

confines far or near, of air or our own kind.<br />
Our looks and longings, which affront the stars,<br />
Most richly bruised against their golden bars,<br />
Delighted captives of their flaming spears,<br />
Find a restraint restrainless which appears<br />
As that is, and so simply natural,<br />
In you;&mdash;the fair detention freedom call,<br />
And overscroll with fancies the loved prison-wall.</p>
<p class="poetry">Such sweet captivity, and only such,<br />
In you, as in those golden bars, we touch!<br />
Our gazes for sufficing limits know<br />
The firmament above, your face below;<br />
Our longings are contented with the skies,<br />
Contented with the heaven, and your eyes.<br />
My restless wings, that beat the whole world through,<br />
Flag on the confines of the sun and you;<br />
And find the human pale remoter of the two.</p>

To all swift things for swiftness did I sue;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clung to the whistling mane of every wind.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But whether they
swept, smoothly fleet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long savannahs of the blue;<br
/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or whether, Thunder-driven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They clanged his
chariot &rsquo;thwart a heaven,<br />
Plashy with flying lightnings round the spurn o&rsquo; their
feet:&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still with
unhurrying chase,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
unperturb&egrave;d pace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>Came on
the following Feet,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And a Voice above their beat&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Naught shelters thee, who
wilt not shelter Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I sought no more that, after which I
strayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In face of man or maid;<br />
But still within the little children&rsquo;s eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems something, something that
replies,<br />
<i>They</i> at least are for me, surely for me!<br />
I turned me to them very wistfully;<br />
But just as their young eyes grew sudden fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With dawning answers there,<br />
Their angel plucked them from me by the hair.<br />
&ldquo;Come then, ye other children,
Nature&rsquo;s&mdash;share<br />
With me&rdquo; (said I) &ldquo;your delicate fellowship;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me greet you lip to lip,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me twine with you caresses,<br
/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wantoning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With our Lady-Mother&rsquo;s
vagrant tresses,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Banqueting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With her in her wind-walled
palace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath her azured
da&iuml;s,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quaffing, as your taintless way
is,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From a chalice<br />
Lucent-weeping out of the dayspring.&rdquo;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So it was done:<br />
<i>I</i> in their delicate fellowship was one&mdash;<br />
Drew the bolt of Nature&rsquo;s secrecies.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I</i> knew all the swift
importings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the wilful face of skies;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>I knew how the clouds arise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spum&egrave;d of the wild
sea-snortings;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All that&rsquo;s born or dies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose and drooped with&mdash;made
them shapers<br />
Of mine own moods, or wailful or divine&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With them joyed and was
bereaven.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was heavy with the even,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she lit her glimmering
tapers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Round the day&rsquo;s dead
sanctities.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I laughed in the morning&rsquo;s
eyes.<br />
I triumphed and I saddened with all weather,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven and I wept together,<br />
And its sweet tears were salt with mortal mine;<br />
Against the red throb of its sunset-heart<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I laid my own to beat,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And share commingling heat;<br />
But not by that, by that, was eased my human smart.<br />
In vain my tears were wet on Heaven&rsquo;s grey cheek.<br />
For ah! we know not what each other says,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These things and I; in sound
<i>I</i> speak&mdash;<br />
<i>Their</i> sound is but their stir, they speak by silences.<br
/>
Nature, poor stepdame, cannot slake my drouth;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let her, if she would owe me,<br
/>
Drop yon blue bosom-veil of sky, and show me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The breasts o&rsquo; her
tenderness:<br />
Never did any milk of hers once bless<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My thirsting mouth.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nigh and nigh draws the chase,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With unperturb&egrave;d pace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deliberate speed majestic
instancy<br />

<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>And past
those nois&egrave;d Feet<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A voice comes yet more fleet&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lo! naught contents thee, who
content&rsquo;st not Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Naked I wait Thy love&rsquo;s uplifted
stroke!<br />
My harness piece by piece Thou hast hewn from me,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And smitten me to my knee;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am defenceless utterly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I slept, methinks, and woke,<br />
And, slowly gazing, find me stripped in sleep.<br />
In the rash lustihead of my young powers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook the pillaring hours<br />
And pulled my life upon me; grimed with smears,<br />
I stand amid the dust o&rsquo; the mounded years&mdash;<br />
My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap.<br />
My days have crackled and gone up in smoke,<br />
Have puffed and burst as sun-starts on a stream.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, faileth now even dream<br />
The dreamer, and the lute the lutanist;<br />
Even the linked fantasies, in whose blossomy twist<br />
I swung the earth a trinket at my wrist,<br />
Are yielding; cords of all too weak account<br />
For earth with heavy griefs so overplussed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah! is Thy love indeed<br />
A weed, albeit an amaranthine weed,<br />
Suffering no flowers except its own to mount?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah! must&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Designer infinite!&mdash;<br />
Ah! must Thou char the wood ere Thou canst limn with it?<br />
<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>My
freshness spent its wavering shower i&rsquo; the dust;<br />
And now my heart is as a broken fount,<br />
Wherein tear-drippings stagnate, spilt down ever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the dank thoughts that
shiver<br />
Upon the sighful branches of my mind.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such is; what is to be?<br />
The pulp so bitter, how shall taste the rind?<br />
I dimly guess what Time in mists confounds;<br />
Yet ever and anon a trumpet sounds<br />
From the hid battlements of Eternity,<br />
Those shaken mists a space unsettle, then<br />
Round the half-glimps&egrave;d turrets slowly wash again;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But not ere him who summoneth<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I first have seen, enwound<br />
With grooming robes purpureal, cypress-crowned;<br />
His name I know, and what his trumpet saith.<br />
Whether man&rsquo;s heart or life it be which yields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee harvest, must Thy harvest
fields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be dunged with rotten death?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now of that long pursuit<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Comes on at hand the bruit;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Voice is round me like a
bursting sea:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And is thy earth so marred,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shattered in shard on shard?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lo, all things fly thee, for thou
fliest Me!</p>
<p

piteous, futile thing!<br />
Wherefore should any set thee love apart?<br />
Seeing none but I makes much of naught&rdquo; (He said),<br />
&ldquo;And human love needs human meriting:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page54"></a><span

Of all man&rsquo;s clotted clay the dingiest clot?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alack, thou knowest not<br />
How little worthy of any love thou art!<br />
Whom wilt thou find to love ignoble thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save Me, save only Me?<br />
All which I took from thee I did but take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not for thy harms,<br />
But just that thou might&rsquo;st seek it in My arms.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All which thy child&rsquo;s
mistake<br />
Fancies as lost, I have stored for thee at home:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rise, clasp My hand, and
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p

by me that footfall:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is my gloom, after all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shade of His hand, outstretched
caressingly?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, fondest, blindest, weakest,<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Athwart</span> the sod
which is treading for God * the poet paced with his splendid
eyes;<br />
Paradise-verdure he stately passes * to win to the Father of
Paradise,<br />
Through the conscious and palpitant grasses * of inter-tangled
relucent dyes.</p>
<p class="poetry">The angels a-play on its fields of Summer *
(their wild wings rustled his guides&rsquo; cymars)<br />
Looked up from disport at the passing comer, * as they pelted
each other with handfuls of stars;<br />
And the warden-spirits with startled feet rose, * hand on sword,
by their tethered cars.</p>
<p class="poetry">With plumes night-tinctured englobed and
cinctured, * of Saints, his guided steps held on<br />
To where on the far cryst&aacute;lline pale * of that transtellar
Heaven there shone<br />
The immutable crocean dawn * effusing from the Father&rsquo;s
Throne.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>Through the reverberant Eden-ways * the bruit of his
great advent driven,<br />
Back from the fulgent justle and press * with mighty echoing so
was given,<br />
As when the surly thunder smites * upon the clang&egrave;d gates
of Heaven.</p>
<p class="poetry">Over the bickering gonfalons, * far-ranged as
for Tartarean wars,<br />
Went a waver of ribb&egrave;d fire *&mdash;as night-seas on
phosphoric bars<br />
Like a flame-plumed fan shake slowly out * their ridgy reach of
crumbling stars.</p>
<p class="poetry">At length to where on His fretted Throne * sat
in the heart of His aged dominions<br />
The great Triune, and Mary nigh, * lit round with spears of their
hauberked minions,<br />
The poet drew, in the thunderous blue * involv&egrave;d dread of
those mounted pinions.</p>
<p class="poetry">As in a secret and tenebrous cloud * the
watcher from the disquiet earth<br />
At momentary intervals * beholds from its ragg&egrave;d rifts
break forth<br />
The flash of a golden perturbation, * the travelling threat of a
witch&egrave;d birth;</p>

whose verges soon,<br />
Slowly and ominously filled * by the on-coming plenilune,<br />
Supportlessly congest with fire, * and suddenly spit forth the
moon:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">With beauty, not terror, through tangled error
* of night-dipt plumes so burned their charge;<br />
Swayed and parted the globing clusters * so,&mdash;disclosed from
their kindling marge,<br />
Roseal-chapleted, splendent-vestured, * the singer there where
God&rsquo;s light lay large.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hu, hu! a wonder! a wonder! see, * clasping the
singer&rsquo;s glories clings<br />
A dingy creature, even to laughter * cloaked and clad in
patchwork things,<br />
Shrinking close from the unused glows * of the seraphs&rsquo;
versicoloured wings.</p>
<p class="poetry">A rhymer, rhyming a futile rhyme, * he had
crept for convoy through Eden-ways<br />
Into the shade of the poet&rsquo;s glory, * darkened under his
prevalent rays,<br />
Fearfully hoping a distant welcome * as a poor kinsman of his
lays.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

*&mdash;&ldquo;Who has done this sorry deed in<br />
The garden of our Father, God? * &rsquo;mid his blossoms to sow
this weed in?<br />
Never our fingers knew this stuff: * not so fashion the looms of
Eden!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The singer bowed his brow majestic, * searching
that patchwork through and through,<br />
Feeling God&rsquo;s lucent gazes traverse * his singing-stoling
and spirit too:<br />
The hallowed harpers were fain to frown * on the strange thing
come &rsquo;mid their sacred crew,<br />
Only the singer that was earth * his fellow-earth and his own
self knew.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the poet rent off robe and wreath, * so as
a sloughing serpent doth,<br />
Laid them at the rhymer&rsquo;s feet, * shed down wreath and
raiment both,<br />
Stood in a dim and sham&egrave;d stole, * like the tattered wing
of a musty moth.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Thou gav&rsquo;st the weed and wreath of
song, * the weed and wreath are solely Thine,<br />
And this dishonest vesture * is the only vesture that is mine;<br

handicraft is not divine!&rdquo;</p>

garmenting which wrought him wrong;<br />

&ldquo;Better thou wov&rsquo;st thy woof of life * than thou
didst weave thy woof of song!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Never a chief in Saintdom was, * but turned him
from the Poet then;<br />
Never an eye looked mild on him * &rsquo;mid all the angel
myriads ten,<br />
Save sinless Mary, and sinful Mary *&mdash;the Mary titled
Magdalen.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Turn yon robe,&rdquo; spake Magdalen, *
&ldquo;of torn bright song, and see and feel.&rdquo;<br />
They turned the raiment, saw and felt * what their turning did
reveal&mdash;<br />
All the inner surface piled * with bloodied hairs, like hairs of
steel.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Take, I pray, yon chaplet up, * thrown
down ruddied from his head.&rdquo;<br />
They took the roseal chaplet up, * and they stood
astonish&egrave;d:<br />
Every leaf between their fingers, * as they bruised it, burst and
bled.</p>

this Thou gav&rsquo;st for wear?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Fetch forth the Paradisal garb!&rdquo; *
spake the Father, sweet and low;<br />
Drew them both by the frightened hand * where Mary&rsquo;s throne

<h3>EPILOGUE.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Virtue</span> may unlock
hell, or even<br />
A sin turn in the wards of Heaven,<br />
(As ethics of the text-book go),<br />
So little men their own deeds know,<br />
Or through the intricate <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i><br />
Guess whitherward draws the battle-sway;<br />
So little, if they know the deed,<br />
Discern what therefrom shall succeed.<br />
To wisest moralists &rsquo;tis but given<br />
To work rough border-law of Heaven,<br />
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Within
this narrow life of ours,<br />
These marches &rsquo;twixt delimitless Powers.<br />
Is it, if Heaven the future showed,<br />
Is it the all-severest mode<br />
To see ourselves with the eyes of God?<br />
God rather grant, at His assize,<br />
He see us not with our own eyes!</p>
<p class="poetry">Heaven, which man&rsquo;s generations draws<br
/>
Nor deviates into replicas,<br />
Must of as deep diversity<br />
In judgment as creation be.<br />
There is no expeditious road<br />
To pack and label men for God,<br />
And save them by the barrel-load.<br />
Some may perchance, with strange surprise,<br />
Have blundered into Paradise.<br />
In vasty dusk of life abroad,<br />
They fondly thought to err from God,<br />
Nor knew the circle that they trod;<br />
And wandering all the night about,<br />
Found them at morn where they set out.<br />
Death dawned; Heaven lay in prospect wide:&mdash;<br />
Lo! they were standing by His side!</p>
<p class="poetry">The rhymer a life uncomplex,<br />
With just such cares as mortals vex,<br />
So simply felt as all men feel,<br />
Lived purely out to his soul&rsquo;s weal.<br />
A double life the Poet lived,<br />
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>And with a
double burthen grieved;<br />
The life of flesh and life of song,<br />
The pangs to both lives that belong;<br />
Immortal knew and mortal pain,<br />
Who in two worlds could lose and gain.<br />
And found immortal fruits must be<br />
Mortal through his mortality.<br />
The life of flesh and life of song!<br />
If one life worked the other wrong,<br />
What expiating agony<br />
May for him damned to poesy<br />
Shut in that little sentence be&mdash;<br />
What deep austerities of strife&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;He lived his life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He lived <i>his</i>
life!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Six foot out of the turf,<br />
And the harebell shakes on the windy hill&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O the breath of the distant surf!&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">The hills look over on the South,<br />

Two children did we stray and talk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wise, idle, childish things.</p>

Her skin was like a grape, whose veins<br />

<p class="poetry">She knew not those sweet words she spake,<br />

<p class="poetry">Her beauty smoothed earth&rsquo;s furrowed

&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave me tokens three:&mdash;<br />
A look, a word of her winsome mouth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a wild raspberry.</p>
<p class="poetry">A berry red, a guileless look,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A still word,&mdash;strings of sand!<br />
And yet they made my wild, wild heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fly down to her little hand.</p>
<p class="poetry">For standing artless as the air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And candid as the skies,<br />
She took the berries with her hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the love with her sweet eyes.</p>
<p class="poetry">The fairest things have fleetest end:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their scent survives their close,<br />
But the rose&rsquo;s scent is bitterness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To him that loved the rose!</p>
<p class="poetry">She looked a little wistfully,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then went her sunshine way:&mdash;<br />
The sea&rsquo;s eye had a mist on it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the leaves fell from the day.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>She went her unremembering way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She went and left in me<br />
The pang of all the partings gone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And partings yet to be.</p>
<p class="poetry">She left me marvelling why my soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was sad that she was glad;<br />
At all the sadness in the sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweetness in the sad.</p>
<p class="poetry">Still, still I seemed to see her, still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look up with soft replies,<br />
And take the berries with her hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the love with her lovely eyes.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nothing begins, and nothing ends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not paid with moan;<br />
For we are born in other&rsquo;s pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And perish in our own.</p>

GODCHILD<br />
FRANCIS M. W. M.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">This</span> labouring,
vast, Tellurian galleon,<br />
Riding at anchor off the orient sun,<br />
Had broken its cable, and stood out to space<br />
Down some frore Arctic of the a&euml;rial ways:<br />
And now, back warping from the inclement main,<br />
Its vaporous shroudage drenched with icy rain,<br />
It swung into its azure roads again;<br />
When, floated on the prosperous sun-gale, you<br />
Lit, a white halcyon auspice, &rsquo;mid our frozen crew.</p>
<p class="poetry">To the Sun, stranger, surely you belong,<br />
Giver of golden days and golden song;<br />
Nor is it by an all-unhappy plan<br />
You bear the name of me, his constant Magian.<br />
Yet ah! from any other that it came,<br />
Lest fated to my fate you be, as to my name.<br />
When at the first those tidings did they bring,<br />
My heart turned troubled at the ominous thing:<br />
Though well may such a title him endower,<br />
For whom a poet&rsquo;s prayer implores a poet&rsquo;s power.<br
/>
The Assisian, who kept plighted faith to three,<br />
To Song, to Sanctitude, and Poverty,<br />
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>(In two
alone of whom most singers prove<br />
A fatal faithfulness of during love!);<br />
He the sweet Sales, of whom we scarcely ken<br />
How God he could love more, he so loved men;<br />
The crown and crowned of Laura and Italy;<br />
And Fletcher&rsquo;s fellow&mdash;from these, and not from me,<br
/>
Take you your name, and take your legacy!</p>
<p class="poetry">Or, if a right successive you declare<br />
When worms, for ivies, intertwine my hair,<br />
Take but this Poesy that now followeth<br />
My clayey hest with sullen servile breath,<br />
Made then your happy freedman by testating death.<br />
My song I do but hold for you in trust,<br />
I ask you but to blossom from my dust.<br />
When you have compassed all weak I began,<br />
Diviner poet, and ah! diviner man;<br />
The man at feud with the perduring child<br />
In you before song&rsquo;s altar nobly reconciled;<br />
From the wise heavens I half shall smile to see<br />
How little a world, which owned you, needed me.<br />
If, while you keep the vigils of the night,<br />
For your wild tears make darkness all too bright,<br />
Some lone orb through your lonely window peeps,<br />
As it played lover over your sweet sleeps;<br />
Think it a golden crevice in the sky,<br />
Which I have pierced but to behold you by!</p>
<p class="poetry">And when, immortal mortal, droops your head,<br
/>
And you, the child of deathless song, are dead;<br />
<a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Then, as
you search with unaccustomed glance<br />
The ranks of Paradise for my countenance,<br />
Turn not your tread along the Uranian sod<br />
Among the bearded counsellors of God;<br />
For if in Eden as on earth are we,<br />
I sure shall keep a younger company:<br />
Pass where beneath their rang&egrave;d gonfalons<br />
The starry cohorts shake their shielded suns,<br />
The dreadful mass of their enridg&egrave;d spears;<br />
Pass where majestical the eternal peers,<br />
The stately choice of the great Saintdom, meet&mdash;<br />
A silvern segregation, globed complete<br />
In sandalled shadow of the Triune feet;<br />
Pass by where wait, young poet-wayfarer,<br />
Your cousined clusters, emulous to share<br />
With you the roseal lightnings burning &rsquo;mid their hair;<br
/>
Pass the crystalline sea, the Lampads seven:&mdash;<br />
Look for me in the nurseries of Heaven.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Summer</span> set lip to
earth&rsquo;s bosom bare.<br />
And left the flushed print in a poppy there:<br />
Like a yawn of fire from the grass it came,<br />
And the fanning wind puffed it to flapping flame.</p>
<p class="poetry">With burnt mouth red like a lion&rsquo;s it
drank<br />
The blood of the sun as he slaughtered sank,<br />
And dipped its cup in the purpurate shine<br />
When the eastern conduits ran with wine.</p>

Treading the skirts of eventide;<br />
But between the clasp of his hand and hers<br />
Lay, felt not, twenty withered years.</p>

hair,<br />

Tossed on the wave of his troubled heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">For <i>he</i> saw what she did not see,<br />
That&mdash;as kindled by its own fervency&mdash;<br />
The verge shrivelled inward smoulderingly:</p>

He knew the twenty withered years&mdash;<br />
No flower, but twenty shrivelled years.</p>

Low to his heart he said; &ldquo;the flower<br />
Of sleep brings wakening to me,<br />
And of oblivion memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Was never this thing to me,&rdquo; he
said,<br />
&ldquo;Though with bruis&egrave;d poppies my feet are

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who all the long

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disclose
yourself to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Already in the
ways<br />
Beyond our human comfortable days;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can you deem
what Death<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his
magniloquent breath;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (And that

could I know, how know<br />
Those laughing words when drenched with sobbing so?<br />
Another voice than yours, than yours, he hath!<br />

This dreadful Death to his own dreadfulness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth dreadful
wrong,<br />
This dreadful childish babble on his tongue!<br />
That iron tongue made to speak sentences,<br />
And wisdom insupportably complete,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In mimicry of
you,&mdash;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And into

Betrayed the secret places of my soul?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teaching him
that his lips,<br />
Uttering their native earthquake and eclipse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could never so
avail<br />
To rend from hem to hem the ultimate veil<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this most
desolate<br />
Spirit, and leave it stripped and desecrate,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, never so
have wrung<br />
From eyes and speech weakness unmanned, unmeet;<br />
As when his terrible dotage to repeat<br />
Its little lesson learneth at your feet;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As when he sits
among<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His sepulchres,
to play<br />
With broken toys your hand has cast away,<br />
With derelict trinkets of the darling young.<br />
Why have you taught&mdash;that he might so complete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His awful
panoply<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From your cast
playthings&mdash;why,<br />

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
